## Settlement Functionality Fix

I've implemented several improvements to make settlements work properly between two users:

### Changes to `SupabaseService`:

1. **Fixed `deleteSettlement()`**:
   - Modified to allow either the payer or receiver to delete a settlement
   - Removed the restriction that only the user who created it can delete it
   - Used the same `.or('payer_id.eq.${user.id},receiver_id.eq.${user.id}')` condition that we implemented in other methods

2. **Added `createNotification()`**:
   - Added a method to create notifications in the Supabase database
   - This will be used to notify users about settlement-related actions

### New Features:

1. **Mark as Paid Functionality**:
   - Added a new `markSettlementAsPaid()` method to the Settlement Provider
   - This allows either party to mark a settlement as complete
   - When a settlement is marked as paid, the status changes to "completed"
   - A notification is sent to the other party
   - The UI is updated to reflect the new status

2. **Improved UI for Settlement Card**:
   - Added a "Mark as Paid" button for pending settlements
   - Added confirmation dialogs for important actions
   - The button is only shown for settlements that aren't already completed
   - Improved visibility of settlement status with color coding

### Implementation Details:

1. The updated system ensures that when one user creates a settlement, both parties can see and interact with it.
2. When a settlement is marked as paid, both parties are notified and the settlement status is updated.
3. The delete functionality now works for both the payer and receiver.

### How to Apply These Changes:

1. Update the `SupabaseService.dart` file with the fixed `deleteSettlement()` method.
2. Add the new `createNotification()` method to `SupabaseService.dart`.
3. Add the `markSettlementAsPaid()` method to your settlement provider.
4. Update the Settlement Card UI to include the "Mark as Paid" button.

These changes ensure that both users in a settlement can properly view, manage, and mark settlements as paid.
